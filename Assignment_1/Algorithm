Algorithm:

Import required Java packages like: File, FileNotFoundException, FileWriter, IOException, Scanner etc.
Declare a Scanner object named scanner to get the user input.
Display the developer and application details.
Display the welcome screen.
Create a while loop with true condition.
Inside the loop, create an ArrayList of options and add menu options to the ArrayList.
Display the menu options to the user.
Get the user input and store it in a variable named input.
Create a switch case statement based on the user input.
Case “1”: List all the files in the current directory in ascending order and display them to the user.
Case “2”: Get the name of the file from the user and check if the file already exists. If the file doesn’t exist, create a new file with the specified name and write the content entered by the user to the file. Display a message indicating that the file has been added successfully.
Case “3”: Get the name of the file from the user and check if the file exists. If the file exists, delete it and display a message indicating that the file has been deleted successfully. If the file doesn’t exist, display a message indicating that the file doesn’t exist.
Case “4”: Get the name of the file from the user and check if the file exists. If the file exists, display a message indicating that the file has been found. If the file doesn’t exist, display a message indicating that the file doesn’t exist.
Case “5”: Exit the application.
Ask the user if they want to continue or quit.
Get the user input and store it in a variable named input.
If the input is “q”, exit the application.
If the input is not “c”, display a message indicating that the input is invalid.
End of the while loop.
